## Custom Terminal Prompt

For an additional personal touch, you can customize your terminal sessions with a custom colored prompt. For a green `$`, add this line to your `~/.zshrc` file:

```sh
PROMPT='%F{green}$ %f'
```

See the [Zsh Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/zsh#Colors) for more color options and additional instructions on how to customize your prompt.
