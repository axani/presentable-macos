# Presentable macOS âœ¨
Notes and Snippets to optimize macOS for screen recording and screen sharing.


## Terminal

Terminals are highly customizable and can be fun to configure. Still, it's important to create a clean and distraction free experience when performing tasks in the terminal. This may also mean to decide against a Zsh configuration framework like [Oh My Zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/) or a Zsh theme like [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k). Otherwise you may confuse students or spend time answering questions on why the student's terminal doesn't look as fancy as yours.

### Decide on the Terminal Emulator

There are exciting terminal emulators like [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) out there. For presentations, a more basic terminal emulator like [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) might be a better choice, though. It's a free application with the right amount of configuration options.

### Customize Your Prompt

For an additional personal touch, you can customize your terminal sessions with a custom colored prompt. For a green `$`, add this line to your `~/.zshrc` file:

```sh
PROMPT='%F{green}$ %f'
```

Customizing your prompt helps you to minimize the characters that every prompt line starts with. Also, you can hide your computer name that's shown in the default prompt.

See the [Zsh Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/zsh#Colors) for more color options and additional instructions on how to customize your prompt.

### Hush the Last Login

When you create a new terminal session you can see the your last terminal login displayed like this:

```
Last login: Fri Feb  2 13:02:47 on ttys000
```

To surpress this message, you can create an empty `.hushlogin` file in your user folder:

```sh
$ touch ~/.hushlogin
```

When macOS sees this file, the last login message doesn't appear anymore.
